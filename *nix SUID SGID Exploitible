What are the security problems of programs with SUID SGID?
The problem is that, if intruders find an executable file that belongs to the root user and has the SUID bit set, they can use that to exploit the system.
Before they leave, they might leave behind their own root-owned file with SUID set, which will allow them to easily gain entry into the system the next time.

SUID and SGID files on your system are a potential security risk, and should be monitored closely. Because these programs grant special privileges to the user
who is executing them, it is necessary to ensure that insecure programs are not installed.
