SYSTEM account is the highest privilege level in the Windows user model. It exists to provide ownership to objects that are created before a normal user logs on, such as the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) and the Session Management Subsystem (SMSS)

SysInternals first released PsExec more than a decade ago, and it has provided administrators a reliable method for remotely accessing systems via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol ever since. The fundamental behavior of PsExec follows a simple pattern:

Establishes an SMB network connection to a target system using administrator credentials
Pushes a copy of a receiver process named PSEXESVC.EXE to the target systemâ€™s ADMIN$ share
Launches PSEXESVC.EXE, which sends input and output to a named pipe
In general, a named pipe is a method of interprocess communication, and various specific pipes are common in Windows Active Directory domains. Pipes may be named for specific uses, and, in this case, a pipe for PsExec communication usually looks like this: \\.\pipe\psexesvc.

In addition to the metadata, a Windows Registry artifact (such as HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\sysinternals\psexec\eulaaccepted) can indicate when PsExec has been used. Additionally, an admin must accept an End-User License Agreement if they want to use the utility, and the acceptance is written to this key. As with binary metadata and named pipe usage, this will not change if PsExec is renamed, but it can be easily removed by an informed adversary.
