Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:

    Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
    Checking job ads related to the target website.
    Reading news articles about the target company.

Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the 
locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.
