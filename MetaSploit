Metasploit Pro: GUI
Metasploit Framework: open-source CmdLine  // useful for vulnerability research 
    main components:
      msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
      Modules: exploit modules, scanner modules, payload modules, etc.
      Tools: Stand-alone tools to help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or pen testing 
             Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. 
Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, 
or performing a brute-force attack

!!!Recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload
                                Vuln: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.
                                Exploit: A piece of code that USES a vulne present on the target system.
                                Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability.get shell, install backdoor, or POC by remotely launching calc.exe
//MODULES
Auxiliary: Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, etc..
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 auxiliary/
Encoders: Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 encoders/
Evasion: While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 2 evasion/
Exploits: Exploits, neatly organized by target system.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 exploits/
NOPs: NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.
    Intel x86 are represented as 0x90, CPU will do nothing for ONE cycle-> often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload size
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 nops/    
Payloads: Payloads are codes that will run on the target system.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 payloads/
        3 different Dirs: SINGLES, STAGER & STAGES
            Singles: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
            Stagers: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
            Stages: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.
