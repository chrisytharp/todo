Metasploit Pro: GUI
Metasploit Framework: open-source CmdLine  // useful for vulnerability research 
    main components:
      msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
      Modules: exploit modules, scanner modules, payload modules, etc.
      Tools: Stand-alone tools to help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or pen testing 
             Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. 
Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, 
or performing a brute-force attack

!!!Recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload
                                Vuln: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.
                                Exploit: A piece of code that USES a vulne present on the target system.
                                Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability.
//MODULES
Auxiliary: Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, etc..
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 auxiliary/
Encoders: Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 encoders/
Evasion: While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 2 evasion/
Exploits: Exploits, neatly organized by target system.
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 exploits/
NOPs: NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.
    Intel x86 are represented as 0x90, CPU will do nothing for ONE cycle-> often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload size
    IN->  /opt/metasploit-framework-5101/modules# tree -L 1 nops/
