!! YARA: hexadecimal strings, text strings and regular expressions!!

--- syntax that resembles the C languag

---rule dummy
   {
       condition:
          false
   }

---YARA starts with the keyword rule followed by a rule identifier. Identifiers must follow the same lexical conventions of the C programming language, they can contain any alphanumeric character and the underscore character, but the first character can not be a digit. Rule identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE and cannot exceed 128 characters.

---Rules are generally composed of two sections: STRING DEFINITAION & CONDITION

--he strings definition section can be omitted if the rule doesn’t rely on any string, but the condition section is always required

--- Each string has an identifier consisting of a $ character followed by a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, 

--Text strings are enclosed in double quotes just like in the C language. Hex strings are enclosed by curly brackets, and they are composed by a sequence of hexadecimal numbers that can appear contiguously or separated by spaces. Decimal numbers are not allowed in hex strings.

---three types of STRINGS in YARA: hexadecimal strings, text strings and regular expressions.

---Text strings in YARA are case-sensitive by default, however you can turn your string into case-insensitive 

--- rule CaseInsensitiveTextExample
   {
       strings:
           $text_string = "foobar" nocase

       condition:
           $text_string
   }

metadata identifiers are always followed by an equals sign and the value assigned to them. The assigned values can be strings, integers, or one of the boolean values
