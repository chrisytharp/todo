Usage
To identify capabilities in a program run capa and specify the input file:

$ capa suspicious.exe

capa supports Windows PE files (EXE, DLL, SYS) and shellcode. To run capa on a shellcode file you must explicitly specify the file format and architecture, for example to analyze 32-bit shellcode:

$ capa -f sc32 shellcode.bin
To obtain detailed information on identified capabilities, capa supports two additional verbosity levels. To get the most detailed output on where and why capa matched on rules use the very verbose option:

$ capa -vv suspicious.exe
If you only want to focus on specific rules you can use the tag option to filter on fields in the rule meta section:

$ capa -t "create TCP socket" suspicious.exe
Display capaâ€™s help to see all supported options and consolidate the documentation:

$ capa -h
