Localhost Listener on TCP and UDP Ports 53
Ubuntu uses a daemon named "systemd-resolved" for resolving DNS queries that you initiate from the system. This daemon listens on the localhost interface on TCP and UDP ports 53. If you're running a tool that attempts to listen on these ports on localhost, your tool might not function properly.
To get around this, reconfigure the tool so it listens on the Ethernet network interface of your REMnux system and not on the localhost network interface. For example, to do this for FakeNet-NG, edit its configuration file /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/fakenet/configs/default.ini so that the LinuxRestrictInterface parameter is set to your Ethernet network interface name, such as ens33.
Alternatively, you can disable the systemd-resolved daemon until the next reboot like this:
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
If you wish to disable systemd-resolved permanently issue the following command. However, note that if you disable this daemon, you will be unable to resolve DNS queries from your REMnux system unless you reconfigure the system's DNS resolver settings. Also, some software, such as OpenVPN and other VPN clients, might not function properly if systemd-resolved is disabled.
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved


docker run --rm -it -u remnux -v ~/:/home/remnux/files remnux/remnux-distro bash
