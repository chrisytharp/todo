sqsh (pronounced skwish), an interactive database shell

A simple syntax would be sqsh -S server -U username -P password, where:

-S server is used to specify the server, for example -S 10.10.30.124
-U username is used to provide the username; for example, -U sa is the username that we have enabled.
-P password lets us specify the password.

To display the table names, you could use the following syntax, SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition.

SELECT * is used to return specific columns (attributes). * refers to all the columns.
FROM table_name to specify the table you want to read from.
WHERE condition to specify the rows (entities).
