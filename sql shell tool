sqsh (pronounced skwish), an interactive database shell

A simple syntax would be sqsh -S server -U username -P password, where:

-S server is used to specify the server, for example -S 10.10.30.124
-U username is used to provide the username; for example, -U sa is the username that we have enabled.
-P password lets us specify the password.

To display the table names, you could use the following syntax, SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition.

SELECT * is used to return specific columns (attributes). * refers to all the columns.
FROM table_name to specify the table you want to read from.
WHERE condition to specify the rows (entities).

 query, SELECT * FROM reindeer.dbo.names;. This SQL query should dump all the contents of the table names from the database reindeer. Note that the ; 
 indicates the end of the SQL query, while go sends a SQL batch to the database.

see if we can run MS Windows commands while interacting with the database. Some MS SQL Servers have xp_cmdshell enabled. If this is the case, we might have access to something similar to a command prompt.

The command syntax is xp_cmdshell 'COMMAND';. Letâ€™s try a simple command, whoami, which shows the user running the commands. In the terminal output below, after connecting to MS SQL Server, we tried 
xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
and we can see that the user is nt service\mssqlserver. This means that any command we pass to xp_cmdshell will run as nt service\mssqlserver

"type filename" to display the contents of a file
