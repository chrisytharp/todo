Sender Policy Framework (SPF) 
Sender ID framework (SIDF) does SPF Record lookup to verify
SPF is used to authenticate the sender of an email. W/ an SPF record in place, ISP can verify that a mail server is authorized to send email for a specific domain.
An SPF record is a DNS TXT record containing a list of the IP addresses that are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.

SPF record:
    v=spf1 ip4:127.0.0.1 include:_spf.google.com -all

        v=spf1 -> This is the start of the SPF record
        ip4:127.0.0.1 -> This specifies which IP (in this case version IP4 & not IP6) can send mail
        include:_spf.google.com -> This specifies which domain can send mail
        -all -> non-authorized emails will be rejected
