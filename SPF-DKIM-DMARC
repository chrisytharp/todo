Sender Policy Framework (SPF) 
Sender ID framework (SIDF) does SPF Record lookup to verify
SPF is used to authenticate the sender of an email. W/ an SPF record in place, ISP can verify that a mail server is authorized to send email for a specific domain.
An SPF record is a DNS TXT record containing a list of the IP addresses that are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain.

SPF record:
    v=spf1 ip4:127.0.0.1 include:_spf.google.com -all

        v=spf1 -> This is the start of the SPF record
        ip4:127.0.0.1 -> This specifies which IP (in this case version IP4 & not IP6) can send mail
        include:_spf.google.com -> This specifies which domain can send mail
        -all -> non-authorized emails will be rejected

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail and is used for the authentication of an email that’s being sent. Like SPF, DKIM is an open standard for email 
authentication that is used for DMARC alignment. A DKIM record exists in the DNS, but it is a bit more complicated than SPF. DKIM’s advantage is that it 
can survive forwarding, which makes it superior to SPF and a foundation for securing your email."

v=DKIM1; k=rsa; 
p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxTQIC7vZAHHZ7WVv/5x/qH1RAgMQI+y6Xtsn73rWOgeBQjHKbmIEIlgrebyWWFCXjmzIP0NYJrGehenmPWK5bF

explanation of the above record:

v=DKIM1-> This is the version of the DKIM record. This is optional. 
k=rsa -> This is the key type. The default value is RSA. RSA is an encryption algorithm (cryptosystem).
p= -> This is the public key that will be matched to the private key, which was created during the DKIM setup process.

DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
DMARC, (Domain-based  Message Authentication Reporting, & Conformance) an open source standard, uses a concept called alignment to tie the result of two
other open source standards, SPF (a published list of servers that are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain) and DKIM (a tamper-evident domain 
seal associated with a piece of email), to the content of an email. If not already deployed, putting a DMARC record into place for your domain will give
you feedback that will allow you to troubleshoot your SPF and DKIM configurations if needed."

v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@website.com 

explanation of the above record:

v=DMARC1 -> Must be in all caps, and it's not optional
p=quarantine -> If a check fails, then an email will be sent to the spam folder (DMARC Policy)
rua=mailto:postmaster@website.com -> Aggregate reports will be sent to this email address

 S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

Per Microsoft, "S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions) is a widely accepted protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages."

As you can tell from the definition above, the 2 main ingredients for S/MIME are:

Digital Signatures
Encryption
Using Public Key Cryptography, S/MIME guarantees data integrity and nonrepudiation. 

If Bob wishes to use S/MIME, then he'll need a digital certificate. This digital certificate will contain his public key. 
With this digital certificate, Bob can "sign" the email message with his private key. 
Mary can then decrypt Bob's message with Bob's public key. 
Mary will do the same (send her certificate to Bob) when she replies to his email, and Bob complete the same process on his end.
Both will now have each other's certificates for future correspondence. 
The illustration below will help you understand how public key cryptography works.
