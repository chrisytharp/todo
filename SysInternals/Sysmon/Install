Installing Sysmon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can also download all of the Sysinternals tools w/ a PowerShell command OR grab the single binary. It is also recommended to use a Sysmon config file along with 
Sysmon to get more detailed & higher-quality event tracing.

        sysmon-config files from SwiftOnSecurity GitHub are good: https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config

You can find the Sysmon binary from the Microsoft Sysinternals website OR use powershell CMD:

        "Download-SysInternalsTools C:\Sysinternals"

To fully utilize Sysmon you will also need to download a Sysmon config or create your own config. We suggest downloading the SwiftOnSecurity sysmon-config. 
A Sysmon config will allow for further granular control over the logs as well as more detailed event tracing.

Starting Sysmon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start Sysmon you will want to open a new PowerShell or Cmd Prompt(as Admin) and use -i SwiftOnSecurity config file:

        "Sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml"

Sysmon is started with the config file, we can look at the "EVENT VIEWER" to monitor events. Eventlog located under:

        "Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational:

Note: You can change the configuration file at any time by uninstalling or updating the current configuration & replacing it with a new configuration file. 
      For more information look through the Sysmon help menu.
