Sysmon Config Overview
----------------------
    Sysmon requires a config file in order to tell the binary how to analyze the events that it is receiving. You can create your own Sysmon config or you can download a config
    Sysmon includes 24 different types of Event IDs, all of which can be used within the config to specify how the events should be handled and analyzed. 
    When creating/modifying config files you will notice that a majority of rules in sysmon-config will exclude events rather than include events.
