log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with a .evt or .evtx
Usual location   ->  C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

3 ways of accessing event logs:
    Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
    Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)        "eventvwr.msc"   <- Type in CMD-Line
    Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet)
    
5 types of events that can be logged
      Error	          An event that indicates a significant problem such as loss of data or loss of functionality. For example, if a service fails to load during startup, an Error event is logged.
      Warning	        An event that is not necessarily significant, but may indicate a possible future problem. For example, when disk space is low, a Warning event is logged. If an application can recover from an event without loss of functionality or data, it can generally classify the event as a Warning event.
      Information	    An event that describes the successful operation of an application, driver, or service. For example, when a network driver loads successfully, it may be appropriate to log an Information event. Note that it is generally inappropriate for a desktop application to log an event each time it starts.
      Success Audit	  An event that records an audited security access attempt that is successful. For example, a user's successful attempt to log on to the system is logged as a Success Audit event.
      Failure Audit	  An event that records an audited security access attempt that fails. For example, if a user tries to access a network drive and fails, the attempt is logged as a Failure Audit event.

Standard logs are visible under Windows Logs
      Application	  Contains events logged by applications. For example, a database application might record a file error. The application developer decides which events to record.
      Security	    Contains events such as valid and invalid logon attempts, as well as events related to resource use such as creating, opening, or deleting files or other objects. An administrator can start auditing to record events in the security log.
      System	      Contains events logged by system components, such as the failure of a driver or other system component to load during startup.
      CustomLog	    Contains events logged by applications that create a custom log. Using a custom log enables an application to control the size of the log or attach ACLs for security purposes without affecting other applications.
