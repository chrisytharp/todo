------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sigcheck  
    Cmdline utility that shows File version, Timestamp info, & digital sig details (including certificate chains)
    It also includes an option to check a fileâ€™s status on VirusTotal and an option to upload a file for scanning

    NOTE: The location of all (Core Windows) executables are in C:\Windows\System32, except for Explorer.exe (which is C:\Windows)
    
    Ex. Check for unsigned files in C:\Windows\System32  ->   "sigcheck -u -e C:\Windows\System32 -accepteula"
          
          -u "If VirusTotal check is enabled, show files that are unknown by VirusTotal or have non-zero detection, otherwise show only unsigned files."
          -e "Scan executable images only (regardless of their extension)"

Streams
    NTFS file sys provides apps the ability to create ADS (alternate data streams) of info. By default, all data is stored in a file's main unnamed data stream, 
    but by using the syntax 'file:stream', you are able to read and write to alternates" 

    ADS is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS. Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of 
    data. Natively, Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives 
    you the ability to view ADS for files.

    Ex. file downloaded from the Internet   ->   "streams C:\Users\Me\Downloads\file.zip -accepteula"
          
          -s "Recursive subdirectories"         IF RESULTS: ":Zone.Identifier:$DATA     185"   <-- INVESTIGATE !!! 
          -d "Delete Streams"

SDelete
    CmdLine utility that takes a number of options. It allows you to delete one or more files and/or directories, or cleanse the free space on a logical disk
    (Secure Delete) implements DOD 5220.22-M (Department of Defense clearing and sanitizing protocol).
          1st PASS: Writes a zero & verifies the write
          2nd PASS: Writes a one & verifies the write
          3rd PASS: Writes a random char & verifies the write
    NOTE: SDelete has been used by adversaries & is MITRE techniques T1485 (Data Destruction) & T1070 (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion)

    USAGE:  sdelete [OPTIONS] <file or directory>
          
          -c	Clean free space. Specify an option amount of space to leave free for use by a running system
          -p	Specifies number of overwrite passes (default 1)
          -r	Remove Read-Only attribute
          -s	Recurse subdirectories
          -z	Zero free space (good for virtual disk optimization)
          -nobanner	Do not display the startup banner and copyright message.
