Prefetch Platform support: Windows Windows uses prefetch to maintain a reference to recently executed code. This reference is stored in the %SYSTEMROOT%\Prefetch directory. Redline lists the prefetch cache contents. For each application name, Redline shows the path, last run and created dates and times, prefetch cache, size, and number of times executed. To view prefetch cache contents, click Prefetch on the Analysis Data windowâ€™s Host tab. If you suspect that an attacker has deleted files, review the accessed files of any known bad processes to find references to files that were deleted. To view the files accessed by applications in the prefetch cache, click Accessed Files under Prefetch. To view the volume name, type, device path, and other information about volumes referenced in the prefetch cache, click Prefetch Volumes under Prefetch.
