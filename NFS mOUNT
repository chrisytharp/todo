2049/tcp open  mountd        1-3 (RPC #100005)


Now that we have discovered an NFS service is listening, let’s check what files are being shared. We can do this using the command showmount.
In the terminal below, we run showmount -e 10.10.12.24. The -e or --exports show the NFS server’s export list.

Let’s try to mount the shares we have discovered. We can create a directory on the AttackBox using mkdir tmp1, where tmp1 is the directory’s name.
Then we can use this directory  we created to mount the public NFS share using: mount 10.10.12.24:/my-notes tmp1

ls /tmp1
