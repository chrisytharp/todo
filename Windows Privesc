Collecting system information
-----------------------------
overview of the target system                 systeminfo
^ a lot of info so grep ->                    systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
corporate environments use                    hostname

Searching files
---------------
                                              findstr /si password *.txt
Command breakdown:
Searches for patterns of text in files                                  findstr
Searches the current directory and all 
  subdirectories (s), ignores upper case / lower case differences (i)   /si:
The command will search for the string “password” in files              password
The search will cover files that have a .txt extension                  *.txt
“.txt”, “.xml”, “.ini”, “*.config”, and “.xls” are good to look for

Patch level
-----------
                                              wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn
NW Connections
--------------
                                              netstat -ano

Schedule Tasks
--------------
                                              schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
Some tasks may be scheduled to run at predefined times. If they run with a privileged account (Admin account) & the executable they run can be modified
by the current user you have, an easy path for privilege escalation can be available.
